# RFC-Twitter-Bot-Detector
Twitter Bot Detector using Random Forest Classifier created for the Honours Project module of my BSc (Hons) Cyber Security and Networks undergraduate degree. 

.py Files and Datasets folder contains "cresci-rtbust-2019" and "TwiBot-22" subfolders
which include their respective Python files, datasets that were used and their original zipped files.

"cresci-rtbust-2019" covers the attempt of using a dataset with features already extracted stopping after the merging of files and before the processing of features.
"twibot-22 no tweepy" covers the final project that was conducted without Tweepy/Developer credentials, one feature (User ID).
